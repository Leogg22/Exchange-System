# Exchange-System
Developed a currency exchange system using C# in Visual Studio, integrating a database for user and transaction management. Users could log in, select currencies, and view real-time exchange rates. The system calculated amounts, displayed required bills and coins, collected user details, and enabled receipt printing for transactions.
